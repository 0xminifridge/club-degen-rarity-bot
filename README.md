# AVAX Club Degen Rarity Tracker

## How It Works
This bot will display token traits and rarity chance percentages for items in supported collections. 
The bot will give the overall rarity score and the rarity ranking of the item in the colletion. Ranking and rarity is determined strictly by trait appearance in relation
to other items in the collection. This means that the most rare traits are the ones appearing the least amount of times in the collection. This bot does not
support custom, collection specific rarity rankings at this time. 

## Calculating Rarity
Rarity chance for a trait = (number of items with trait / number of items with trait type) * 100 

Rarity score for a trait = 1 / (number of items with trait / number of items with trait type)

Total rarity score is the sum of the rarity scores for each trait. 

Each item is ranked based on its rarity score in the collection

## Add Your Collection
If you are the owner or a team member of a collection, contact CrypTooker about adding yourself to the rarity tracker. Ideally, it is best to wait until your collection is minted out 
before contacting about being added. For collections that have not minted out there will be an additional 4 AVAX charge due to the fact that extra work must be done
to continue to update data weekly for updated rarity rankings. 

### Requirements to Join
